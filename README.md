Assignment:

Design and implement a car rental system using object-oriented principles. 

The system should allow reserving a car of a given type at a desired date and time for a given number of days. There are 3 types of cars (sedan, SUV and van).

The number of cars of each type is limited.

Use Java as the implementation language. Use unit tests to prove the system satisfies the requirements.
